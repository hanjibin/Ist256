    "In P2, I planned a few enhancements that I could improve to make my data story stronger and impactful and I actually implemented them in P3 while also considering the feedback from my TA. First, I used the existing region codes which were just numeric code such as 1,2,3,4… to create a new variable called region_label_simple with readable region names like “Seoul,” “Kyeong-gi,” and “Jeolla and Jeju.” Then I compared both average income by region and income per person across these regions using bar charts and folium map. I also added average income over time by region, so it shows that income differences are not only about personal factors but also related to where people live.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also extended my occupation analysis from P2 by comparing the gender composition within the Top 10 and Bottom 10 occupations by average income. So that it visually shows if high paying jobs are more male dominated while lower paying jobs have a slightly higher share of women.\n",
    "\n",
    "I created a new variable called “income_per_person” by dividing income by the number of family members that individuals have. I used this in several parts especially when comparing age groups, regions, and non-working groups. I tried this way since I assumed that the people with the same income can have very different living situations depending on how many people/family members they support. Thus, 1 person or single person households and large families should not be treated the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "I reorganized the reason_none_worker values and made a detailed version into a broader variable called reason_group as I grouped similar reasons together such as “house worker”, “caring kids at home”, and “nursing” into “care and housework” and “no capable” and “others” into “health issue / other.” I then focused only on non-workers and compared both the counts and average income per person across these groups. This makes it easier to see and talk about different types of non-working reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, I also simplified several other variables by turning it into readable labels like gender_label_simple, education_label_simple, and age_group_simple and I wrote functions to calculate average income by category to support my analysis (based on the feedback I got). I used these functions together with interact and interact_manual so that the user can switch between gender, education, age group, region and metric type simply. All of these changes turn my exploration of enhancements from P2 into a clearer and interactive data story in P3."
